### Base Idea and Introduction
###### Singular Value Decomposition is as simple as its name, its a method of decomposing matrix into matrices composed of singular values. Of course it is a little more intuitvie than that. Given a matrix, $A$, of size $m \times n$ we can factorize this matrix into the following form,
$$A = U\Sigma V^{T}$$
###### These matrices are defined below:
- U: An $m \times m$ orthogonal matrix 
- V: An $n \times n$ orthogonal matrix 
- $\Sigma$: A $m \times n$ diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal
